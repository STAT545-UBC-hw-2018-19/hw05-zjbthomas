## Overview

**This is the repository for STAT 545A Homework 05 maintained by Junbin ZHANG.** Welcome!

This repo contains the following files:
- This [README](README.md) file; 
- A [R markdown](hw05.rmd) file. This R Markdown file is the source code used by R Studio only. **If you want to see the final results/graphs/tables, please refer to [HTML preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-zjbthomas/blob/master/hw05.html) (recommended)** or [knitted HTML](hw05.html).
- A knitted [markdown](hw05.md) file. However, it is **not recommended** to read it on GitHub (issue reported [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal/issues/30)). **In addition, this homework relies on `ggplotly()` and `plot_ly` which only works in HTML file.** The following error is shown if the R markdown file is knitted as `github_document`:

> Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting gfm-ascii_identifiers output.
Please change the output type of this document to HTML.
